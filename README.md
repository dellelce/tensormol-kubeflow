# tensormol-kubeflow

Can you run TensorMol in kubeflow?

## Closing this project

After reviewing Tensormol I decided to end this test because the basic dependency of a commercial program (QChem) needed for ground state and other basic calculations. There is an interface to Pyscf but it does not appear to be used.
